## Why Install
Accelerate everyday Glueful tasks: explore routes, inspect performance, catch security issues early, debug smarter, and manage extensions‚Äîall without leaving VS Code.

## Core Features (At a Glance)
- **Routes Explorer & Panel**: Search, filter, jump to handler.
- **Performance Dashboard**: Live CPU / memory, slow queries, routes, cache stats.
- **Security Center**: Scan code & dependencies, view actionable issues.
- **Advanced Debugging**: Breakpoints list, query & profiler views.
- **Extension Manager**: Enable/disable framework extensions visually.
- **Context Docs**: Quick access to framework guides & cookbook.

## Quick Start
1. Install from Marketplace (search: ‚ÄúGlueful Framework Tools‚Äù).
2. Open a Glueful project (auto-detects structure).
3. Open Command Palette ‚Üí type `Glueful:` to see available commands.
4. Start with: `Glueful: Routes Panel`, `Glueful: Performance Dashboard`, `Glueful: Security Report`.
5. (Optional) Set `glueful.cliPath` if your CLI is not in the default location.

## Everyday Workflows
| Task | Command Palette Entry | Result |
|------|-----------------------|--------|
| View all routes | Glueful: Routes Panel | Filter & jump to controllers |
| Investigate slowness | Glueful: Performance Dashboard | See slow queries & routes |
| Check security posture | Glueful: Security Report | Score + issues + vulnerabilities |
| Debug activity | Glueful: Advanced Debugging | Sessions, breakpoints, queries |
| Manage extensions | Glueful: Extensions Dashboard | Enable/disable & inspect |

## Configuration (Optional)
Add to your VS Code settings JSON if you need overrides:
```jsonc
{
  "glueful.cliPath": "php vendor/bin/glueful",
  "glueful.autoRefresh": true,
  "glueful.performance.enabled": true,
  "glueful.security.autoScan": true
}
```

## Security (Plain Language)
Your data stays local. Webviews are locked down with:
- Strict Content Security Policy & sandboxed panels
- Central factory enforcing HTML escaping & no remote scripts
- Local vendored assets (no CDN execution)
- Build-time checks to prevent regressions

Full details: see the **[Security Compliance Matrix](./SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md)**.

## Troubleshooting
| Problem | Hint |
|---------|------|
| Routes list is empty | Run your Glueful CLI once; ensure project root detected. |
| Performance metrics flat | App logs/metrics files not present yet (traffic required). |
| Security score 0 | Initial scan not finished‚Äîre-run `Glueful: Security Scan`. |
| No Glueful commands appear | Workspace not recognized; ensure `composer.json` + framework structure. |
| CLI errors | Check `glueful.cliPath` or run the command manually in terminal. |

## FAQ
**Does it modify my code?** Only when you explicitly trigger actions (e.g., create files). Passive views never alter source.

**Internet required?** Only for opening external documentation URLs; core features work offline.

**Telemetry?** None. No tracking or data upload.

**Safe for production repos?** Yes‚Äîoperations are read-focused unless you invoke scaffolding or fixes.

## Requirements
- VS Code 1.93.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- Glueful framework project
